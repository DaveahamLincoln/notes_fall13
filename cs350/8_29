short 	16 bits
int 	32 bits
long 	64 bits
float 	32 bits
double 	64 bits
bool 	(t/f)
char 	16 bits

Arithmetic operators
+-*/%

Arithmetic expression (informal and inexhaustible)
A constant is expression
A variable is an expression
If P and Q are operations and (._.) is an operator, P (._.) Q is a binary operator, then (._.) is an expression too.

Rounding up and down:
7/3
>2

(7.0/3)+.5
<(7.0/3.0)+.5
<x=						((7.0/3.0)+.5)		.toInteger 
>x 						//rounded up or down as the case may be.

Bitwise and Shift Operators
~, 	unary bitwise complement
&, 	bitwise AND
|, 	bitwise OR
^, 	bitwise XOR
<<, shift left
>>, shift right

a = 5	.toBinary
	00000101

b = 8	.toBinary
	00001000

a & b 
>False.  At no point does a have a t where b has one.

a>>2
00000001

(shift a over 2 blocks (add 0 to the front))

Relational Operators
== 	equal to
!= 	not equal to
> 	greater than
>= 	greater than or equal to
< 	less than
<= 	less than or equal to

Logical Operators
&&	AND
||	OR
!	NOT

Ternary Operator
X?Y:Z
