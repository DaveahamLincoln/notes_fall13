Overriding requires function to have the same name, return type, and 
	number of parameters as the function being overriden.

Overloading ex. 

function() {
	
}

function(param) {
	
}

this.n refers to data member n (i.e. Class A has n, Class B extends A.  
	this.n refers to Class A's n.)

Protected fields can be accessed by all members of the same package.  (???)

Each file in java can only have one public class (has the same name as the file).

Constructor overloading-
	public class employee {

		public employee(String first, String last, String ssn){
			firstName = first;
      		lastName = last;
      		socialSecurityNumber = ssn;
		}

		//Overloaded constructor.
		public employee(String first, String last){
			firstName = first;
      		lastName = last;
      		socialSecurityNumber = "000-00-0000";
		}


	}

}
